The project uses Selenium to demonstrate web scraping, API integration, and cross-browser testing. The script scrapes the first five articles from the Opinion section of El Pa√≠s, saves their  cover images if it exists, and translates the titles to English using a translation API. It also analyzes the translated titles to identify any words that are repeated more than twice across all headers combined. Finally, the solution is tested locally and executed on BrowserStack with 5 parallel threads across various desktop and mobile browsers.
